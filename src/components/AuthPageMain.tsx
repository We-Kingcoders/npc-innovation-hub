// src/components/AuthPageMain.tsx
//
// The shared page frame for every auth page (Login, Sign Up, OTP
// Verification, Forgot Password). Previously each page had its own
// hand-rolled copy of a two-column layout - a plain, strongly-gradiented
// photo on the left and a separately-tinted copy of the same photo behind
// the form on the right, visually two different backgrounds stitched
// together rather than one. Now it's a single hubimage.jpg + navy-tint
// backdrop behind the whole row, with the feature highlights and the form
// (passed as children) both floating on top of it as one consistent
// surface - the two-sided look is gone, by construction, everywhere this
// is used.
