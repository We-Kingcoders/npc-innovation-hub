          Since our establishment in 2024, NPC Innovation Hub has been at the
          forefront of technology-driven learning at the National Police
          College. We are more than just a workspace, we are a catalyst for
          innovation, a platform for serving and strengthening our institution,
          and a home for the College&apos;s brightest tech minds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Located within the National Police College, we provide a dynamic
          ecosystem where developers, designers, and innovators converge to
          collaborate, learn, and build solutions that serve our institution.

          with the paragraph text above at md:justify-start - but this
          container has no matching horizontal padding of its own to
          absorb it, so applied unconditionally it just made the row 48px
          wider than its parent and overflowed the viewport on mobile,
          where the row is centered anyway and the alignment doesn't
          matter. Scoped to md: where both the intent and the room for it
          actually apply. */}
