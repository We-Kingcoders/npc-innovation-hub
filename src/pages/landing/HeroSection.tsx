/**
 * HeroSection Component
 *
 * Production-ready hero section for NpcInnovationHub landing page
 * Matches reference design with pixel-perfect accuracy
 *
 * Features:
 * - Background photo (Hub students at work) at every breakpoint, under one
 *   uniform navy scrim (not a per-column split) so headline, paragraph
 *   and tagline all read the same regardless of what part of the photo
 *   sits behind them - klab.rw's own hero uses the same one-overlay-for-
 *   the-whole-image approach.
 *   Headline/paragraph/button/dots/tagline are white throughout, with a
 *   drop-shadow as insurance against the photo's own brightness.
 * - Responsive navigation with hamburger menu
 * - Single full-width text column over the photo (klab.rw-style, not a
 *   40/60 two-column split) - headline and paragraph wrap naturally into
 *   as many lines as their own length needs, rather than being squeezed
 *   into an artificially narrow side column. No member photos/roster
 *   here (that lives in its own homepage section further down, and its
 *   own full /members page).
 * - Fully accessible and mobile-responsive
 * - Rotates through 4 headline/subtext messages
 * - CTA row (Join Us + slide dots + the "Innovate. Create. Lead."
 *   tagline) sits together on one line near the bottom of the hero
 *
 * Updates:
 * - Removed the team-member photo carousel that used to occupy a
 *   separate right column (name/role cards) - the Hub's members are
 *   presented in their own dedicated homepage section and /members page
 *   instead, not repeated inside the hero.
 * - Collapsed the two-column layout into one full-width column: the
 *   40%-wide text column was forcing every headline onto 3-4 cramped
 *   one-word lines regardless of how short the slide actually was. The
 *   tagline that used to live alone in the freed-up right column now
 *   sits in the CTA row instead, alongside Join Us and the slide dots.
 * - Extended the desktop-only photo/navy-overlay background and white
 *   text/button/dots/tagline treatment to every breakpoint, replacing the
 *   flat white + navy text mobile/tablet previously had, so the hero
 *   reads as one consistent identity regardless of device

          BACKGROUND DESIGN - Photo, navy overlay (all breakpoints)
          A real photo of the Hub's own students at work, reusing the
          existing public/assets/images/hubimage.jpg (already shipped and
          used on the auth pages) rather than adding a second, much
          heavier copy of the same picture. Was lg-only, with mobile/
          tablet staying flat white instead (a full photo behind wrapping
          single-column text risked contrast problems wherever a line
          landed on the image's darker areas) - now shown at every
          breakpoint to match the desktop identity, with the overlay
          below doing more work at the breakpoints that need it to keep
          that promise.
          -top-[83px]/-top-[67px]: the fixed Navbar reserves its own
          height via a spacer div rendered ABOVE this section in the page
          (67px below lg, 83px at lg - see Navbar.tsx), so this section's
          own top edge already starts below it - inset-0/top-0 would leave
          that reserved strip showing the plain white page background
          instead of this photo. Extending the top edge up by the navbar's
          own height at each breakpoint reaches into that reserved strip
          instead, without moving this section's box (bottom-0 keeps the
          bottom edge anchored) or the spacer's height (still reserves the
          same space for every OTHER route/state, so nothing else shifts).
          Needs overflow-x-hidden, not overflow-hidden, on the section
          above - overflow-hidden would clip this negative offset before
          it ever reaches up past the section's own top. */}

            the mercy of whatever's directly behind it in the photo (a
            bright laptop screen, a pale shirt); a single consistent tint
            guarantees every line - headline, paragraph, tagline - reads
            the same regardless of position, the same way klab.rw's own
            hero holds one dark overlay across its full image rather than

          <main id="main-content"> that covers all of it lives there instead
          - see that file's comment for why.
          One full-width column, not a 40/60 split - klab.rw's own hero
          lets its headline use the whole viewport's width and just wraps
          onto however many lines its own length needs; a narrow side
          column was forcing every slide here onto 3-4 one-word lines
          regardless of how short the sentence actually was. pt-10 is just
          breathing room under the fixed navbar (which reserves its own

        {/* Rotating headline/subtext - fades out, swaps, fades back in.
            max-w caps line length for readability without artificially
            narrowing the column itself, so a short slide (e.g. "Where
            Students Become Builders.") sits on one line while a longer
            one (e.g. "From First Line of Code to Finished Project.")
            wraps to two - each at whatever length it actually needs,
            not a fixed one-word-per-line squeeze. min-h reserves the
            tallest of the 4 slides' actual rendered height at each
            breakpoint (measured directly, not guessed - headline
            line-count doesn't track paragraph line-count, so the
            "obviously longest" slide isn't the tallest one at every
            width) so the CTA row below never jumps up and down as the
            active slide changes. aria-live="polite" announces the
            change to screen readers without interrupting them
            mid-sentence, and pausing on hover/focus (see this section's
            own handlers and the buttons' onFocus below) keeps this from
            being content that auto-updates with no way to stop it. */}
